# Code Execution

We can render documents that have Python code or R code.

For Python, we can render .PY files, .IPYNB files, as well as .QMD files that have Python code blocks. Examples:

  + [Python Example (.QMD)](python-example.qmd)
  + [Notebook Example (.IPYNB)](demo-notebook.ipynb)

For R, we can render .R files and .QMD files that have R code blocks.

  + [R Example (.QMD)](r-example.qmd)
